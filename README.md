# EE553 MIDI Display / Music Editor
This is the main GitHub repository for the MIDI Diplay / Music Editor project for Dov Kruger's EE553: Engineering Programming C++ at Stevens.

The main functionality of the program is to read data from simple MIDI files, use that data to construct a visual representation in standard music notation in the main GUI, and print/save that data to a PDF file.

The "musicEditor" folder contains the final version of our codebase as well as some required files (specifically the Norfolk Std. font and example MIDI files).

The "old" folder contains WIP code used to build and evalute our classes during development as well as additional unused code written for testing and learning purposes.
